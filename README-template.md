### What I learned

The things, that I parctice a lot in this project is the regex.
A little definition about regex from w3 schools: 

It is a regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

Now, some examples of regex that I use for the project...

```
let regexvalidateNumber = /[\+\-]+[^\d*\.?\d+$/]/gi;//we check if the operation is a sign + or - followed by an integer or a number with a comma.

  let regexvalidateError = /^[\x\+\/\-]+$\d$/gi;//we check if the operation is an operator followed by a possible number or not...

```
